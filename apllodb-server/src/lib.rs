#![deny(missing_debug_implementations)]

//! apllodb's server instance.
//!
//! Although serve should be bin crate and accept connections from clients in main loop,
//! I cannot find any good RPC server implementation to use with ApllodbImmutableSchemaEngine for now.
//! See: <https://github.com/darwin-education/apllodb/pull/67>
//!
//! This crate directly depends on apllodb-immutable-schema-engine currently, although apllodb's storage engine is designed to be plugable.
//! See <https://github.com/darwin-education/apllodb/issues/47#issuecomment-753779450> for future plan.
//!
//! # What's tested here?
//!
//! apllodb-server crate has a number of E2E tests in `tests/` directory.
//!
//! Here shows rules of file name and type of tests:
//!
//! | File name | Test type |
//! |--|--|
//! | `tests/func_*.rs` | Functional tests to: <ul><li>quickly shows what type of SQLs are currently supported</li><li>tests with heuristic edge cases</li><li>proceed TDD</li></ul> |
//! | `tests/scenario_*.rs` | Scenario tests. |
//!
//! There also are fuzzing tests in `fuzz/` directory written with `cargo-fuzz`.
//! Purpose of fuzzing tests in apllodb-server are to assure crash-safety with:
//!
//! - with very complex (so that people cannot write by hand) valid SQLs.
//!   - "SELECT country.country_name_eng, SUM(CASE WHEN call.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS calls, AVG(ISNULL(DATEDIFF(SECOND, call.start_time, call.end_time),0)) AS avg_difference FROM country LEFT JOIN city ON city.country_id = country.id LEFT JOIN customer ON city.id = customer.city_id LEFT JOIN call ON call.customer_id = customer.id GROUP BY country.id, country.country_name_eng ORDER BY calls DESC, country.id ASC;"
//! - with arbitrary string inputs (most of them are invalid for SQL).
//!   - E.g. `"as\0ðŸ˜¤é¬± sfsã€€ãŒ€"`
//! - with arbitrary SQL values that each SQL datatype allows.
//!
//! In short, `fuzz/` tests crash-safety with large number of complex SQL commands & SQL values.
